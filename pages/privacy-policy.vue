          our legitimate interests in operating and securing the Services, with your
          consent, and/or to comply with legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h3>Sharing and disclosures</h3>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal data. We may share information with trusted service
          providers that help us operate the Services (e.g., hosting, analytics), subject
          to appropriate safeguards; to comply with law or legal processes; to protect the
          rights, property, or safety of Nosana, our users, or the public; or with your

          We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply

          periods may vary depending on the type of data and applicable requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, rectify, delete, or
          restrict the processing of your personal data, as well as the right to data
          portability and to object to certain processing. You may also withdraw consent at
          any time where processing is based on consent. To exercise these rights, please

        <h3>International transfers</h3>
        <p>

          safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms, as
          required by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect your
          information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure,
          and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h3>Childrenâ€™s privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by
          local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you
          believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can
          take appropriate action.
